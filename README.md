# Exercise No: 01 â†’ Git to GitHub  

This exercise demonstrates the complete workflow of Git, from repository initialization to collaboration on GitHub. It begins by creating a local repository, staging changes, and committing files. Configuration and history inspection commands are introduced, along with branch creation, switching, and merging strategies. Remote repository integration covers adding origins, pushing with authentication tokens, and working across multiple remotes. Additional steps illustrate file editing, resetting commits, and syncing with GitHub after changes. The exercise also highlights branch workflows, including Aniket and my-b, with fetch, pull, and merge operations. Overall, it provides a structured foundation for effective Git usage.
