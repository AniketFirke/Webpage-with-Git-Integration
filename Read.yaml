This way, your **README.md** becomes an interactive tutorial:
- **Diagram 1** â†’ Git init & first commit  
- **Diagram 2** â†’ Branching & merging  
- **Diagram 3** â†’ Remote origin & pushes  
- **Diagram 4** â†’ Cloning & working with another repo

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to **generate the full README.md file** with these diagrams already written out, so you can copy-paste directly into your repo?
