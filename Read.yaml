### 🔍 Explanation of Diagram:
- **main** branch starts with the first commit.  
- **Aniket** branch is created, commits are made, then merged back into **main**.  
- A new branch **my-b** is created, worked on, and also merged back.

👉 Do you want me to **embed multiple diagrams** in the README (e.g., one for initialization workflow, one for branching/merging), or just keep a **single main flow chart**?
